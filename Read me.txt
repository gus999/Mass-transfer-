-Shockwave Flash has shown some issues to save it with the component activated or trying to deactivate it and save it right after. Perhaps, a compatibily issue of running it on Win 10.
as of today, I haven't been able to save this form with Shockwave Flash activated. If you figure out what the problem is, please comment.
